        <article>
            <p>I am an adjuct research professor at UNC Chapel Hill. Most of my work involves intracete calculations and visualizations
                that help further the understanding of the interior of the Earth. If you think this sounds too technical
                and boring to you than it may come as a surprise if I tell you that my work also involves travelling to places
                and working out in the wilderness where no man has set a foot on (like Antarctica for instance...). Yes,
                some may think this is way too cool but nothing comes for free. The fieldwork that I carry out sometimes
                requires to carry out some laborious activities such as diging 6 feet deep holes in the ground, mixing and
                pouring concrete and carrying 80 lbs concrtete bags up the mountains. Well... and it is totally worth it
                :)</p>
            <p>Aside from work, I recently became a father. I have a 1 year old daughter, whose progress of growth (both mental
                and physical) amazes me eveyday. I love spending time wirth her and playing games. I have never imagened
                I would enjoy playing pick-a-boo as a grown man this much...In addition to the passion for my family, I am
                also consumed with computer programming and coding. Infact, I feel that coding is the best part of my current
                work (even better than fieldwork!!!). This is the sole reason for my decision to take some important steps
                towards learning web development and starting my journey towards a career in coding.</p>
